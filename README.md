# neuralNetLab
Experiments using synaptic.js JavaScript neural net library.

## Installing

1. Clone the repo.
2. In console, `npm install`.
3. Run `node ./contractEvaluatorExample.js` to see example training and resulting behaviour of a network to evaluate software development opportunities. 

   This is based on whether it's a permanent or contract role, how far away the site is, and whether there is an opportunity to work from home. These are coded as values between 0 and 1 representing "contraciness", "nearness", and "telecommutiness".
   
   The training in this case involves me telling it my preference to do only contract, the nearer the better, unless remote work is an option.
